**Recommendet approach for proper versioning with Git:**
1. Checkout the dev-branch into a folder of your choice
2. Download the source code of the dev-branch as zip file and install it on Joomla
3. Remove the installed component folders within your Joomla installation
   - administrator/components/com_joomgallery
   - components/com_joomgallery
   - media/com_joomgallery
   - plugins/finder/joomgallerycategories
   - plugins/finder/joomgalleryimages
   - plugins/privacy/joomgalleryimages
   - plugins/privacy/webservices/joomgallery
4. Create symbolic links from those folders to the corresponding folders within the checked out copy of your component
5. Remove the installed component language files within your Joomla installation
   - administrator/language/en-GB/com_joomgallery.ini
   - administrator/language/en-GB/com_joomgallery.exif.ini
   - administrator/language/en-GB/com_joomgallery.iptc.ini
   - administrator/language/en-GB/com_joomgallery.sys.ini
   - language/en-GB/com_joomgallery.ini
6. Create symbolic links from those files to the corresponding files within the checked out copy of your component
7. The referenced copy of your component can be properly versioned using Git
