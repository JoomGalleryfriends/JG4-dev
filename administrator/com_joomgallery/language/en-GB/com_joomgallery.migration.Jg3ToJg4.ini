This script could result in errorous migration results. We strongly advise to clean up the database manually before starting the migration. For all the affected Images you have to do the following:<ul><li>Rename the thumbnail image in the filesystem to be the one set in the old JoomGallery image table at row 'imgfilename'.</li><li>In the old JoomGallery image table, set the value of the row 'imgthumbname' to be the same as in row 'imgfilename'.</li></ul><br/>ID's of affected images: (%s)"

FILES_JOOMGALLERY_MIGRATION_CHECK_CATEGORY_CATPATH_DESC="There are inconsistent category folder paths defined in the database of your JG3 tables. Please adjust affected category paths manually, or switch off 'Use new folder structure' in step 1 to use the old static catpath instead"
FILES_JOOMGALLERY_MIGRATION_CHECK_CATEGORY_CATPATH_HELP="Some categories in the database table of the JG3 (source, #__com_joomgallery_catg) do not have consistent data entries for cid, name, alias, and catpath. This happened because of a bug in previous JoomGallery versions which was fixed in JoomGallery v3.7.0. Thus an inconsistent data basis in the database was created when renaming or moving categories without clearing the alias field. This inconsistency prevents a migration into the new folder structure and without compatibility mode activated.<br /><br />There are two options to solve that:<ul><li>Clean up the source database manually or by using the maintenance manager of JoomGallery v3.7.0. (recommended)</li><li>Disable 'Use new folder structure' in the migration options and activate 'JG3 compatibility mode' in the component configuration. (not recommended)</li></ul>We strongly advise to clean up the database before starting the migration. This way JoomGallery can be migrated into the proper, new structure which corresponds to the Joomla way of doing it. This will prevent your system for errors and illogical behaviour patterns.<br /><br />A consistent JG3 category table (#__com_joomgallery_catg) fulfils the following conditions:<ul><li><strong>alias = parentalias/title</strong><br />where title is converted into an URL safe string (lowercase, no special characters and umlauts, no whitespaces, ...)</li><li><strong>path = parentpath/title_cid</strong><br />where title is converted just like the alias and cid is the category id.</li></ul><br/>ID's of affected categories: (%s)"

This might be wrong if you renamed category titles without regenrating the alias. In this case a convertion of the old JG3- folder structure to the new one is not possible.<br />If you choose to keep the old folder structure, you have to switch on the 'JG3 compatibility mode' in the components global configuration in order for the component to find images stored in the old folder structure style."
